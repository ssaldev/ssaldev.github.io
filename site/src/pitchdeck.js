                                        The gameplay is already very loud and noisy, so simple colors end up balancing with that really well.
                                        Individual pixels are not as important when it comes to character art, since most of the time they will be flying so fast across the screen, that you cannot see them anyway.

                                        Characters are created in blender, by sculpting a high poly model first, and then creating a shrinkwrap low poly model thats used in the game,
                                        extra detail is added through a baked normal map.
